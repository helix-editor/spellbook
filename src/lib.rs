/// Compressed representation of a Flag.
///
/// Flags are used as attributes about words. For example a flag might mark a word as forbidden,
/// or it might prevent that word from being suggested. Words in a dictionary have sets of flags
/// associated to them that control which prefixes and suffixes apply to them.
///
/// For a simple example, consider a line in a dic file with the contents `drink/X`. "drink" has
/// just one flag: `X`. That `X` flag corresponds to a suffix rule in the en_US dictionary that
/// allows the "drink" _stem_ in the dictionary to be conjugated as full words like "drinkable."
///
/// Dictionaries declare a `FlagType` they will use to express flags. This `Flag` can represent
/// each of the four types.
///
/// * `FlagType::Short`: ASCII 8-bit characters are casted into 16 bits.
/// * `FlagType::Long`: the first ASCII character occupies the higher 8 bits and the second ASCII
///   character occupies the lower 8 bits.
/// * `FlagType::Numeric`: the flag is represented as a 16 bit integer.
/// * `FlagType::Utf8`: if the flag is fit into two bytes. Hunspell and Nuspell restrict UTF8
///   flags to UTF8 code-points representable in one or two bytes. Flags are just attributes, so
///   using symbols, emoji or non-latin alphabets is unnecessary. Languages like `ar` (Arabic)
///   use the `FlagType::Numeric` encoding for example.
///
/// Finally, a flag with a value of zero is not valid for any `FlagType`, so we can safely
/// represent this as a _non-zero_ u16. Hunspell calls this zero flag "`FLAG_NULL`". Layout
/// optimizations allow us to represent `Option<Flag>` in 16 bits.
///
/// Hunspell uses an `unsigned short` for flags while Nuspell uses a `char16_t`.

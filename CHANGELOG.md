<!-- ## [Unreleased] -->

## [v0.3.3] - 2025-04-21

### Fixed

* Fixed a panic possible in the suggester when suggesting corrections for a word with
  non-ASCII characters near the end in dictionaries with replacement patterns with end
  anchors.
    * For example `cafÃ©x` in a french dictionary which has a `REP Ã¨$ e` rule.

## [v0.3.2] - 2025-04-15

### Fixed

* Aligned parsing of flags with Hunspell. This fixes cases where a dictionary would
  use non-ASCII characters for flags without setting `FLAG UTF-8`.

## [v0.3.1] - 2025-03-11

### Fixed

* Fixed handling of Unicode flags which are represented by more than one code
  unit in UTF-16 representation, for example emoji such as 'ðŸ”­'.

## [v0.3.0] - 2025-02-04

### Added

* Exposed the `Checker` type.
* Added `Checker::check_lower_as_title` and `Checker::check_lower_as_upper` to
  configure the checker to try lowercase words as title and/or uppercase.

### Changed

* The `default-hasher` feature flag now uses [`foldhash`](https://github.com/orlp/foldhash)
  instead of [`ahash`](https://github.com/tkaitchuck/aHash).

## [v0.2.0] - 2024-11-18

### Added

* Added support for `Dictionary::suggest` and the `Suggester` type.

### Updated

* Changed the internal representation of word stems and flagsets for reduced
  memory consumption. [More...](https://the-mikedavis.github.io/posts/german-string-optimizations-in-spellbook/)
